# World Models - "Can agents learn inside of their own dreams"?

This projects is a reproduction of the [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io) paper.

# Motivation

Evidence suggest our perception is governed by our brain's prediction of the future based on our internal model. Can we build models of the world? Can we train and learn in our imagined world?

# Learning

## Concepts

* Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)
* LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Network with Mixture Density Network (MDN)
* Covariance- Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)

## Coding

* Use of pytest for running tests
* Use of dataclasses for configuration parameters
